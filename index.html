【34】Rudolph was a reindeer born with a bright red nose. Because of his nose, the other reindeer always made fun of him. Rudolph felt very sad and had no confidence in himself.
　One Christmas Eve, Santa Claus was ready to leave to deliver presents. He had eight famous reindeer to pull his sleigh. However, suddenly a very thick fog covered the sky. It became difficult to see.
　Santa was in trouble. He said, "It is too dark. I cannot find the chimneys." He could not start his journey in the dark. Then, Santa noticed a crowd looking at something. It was Rudolph. His red nose was shining like a light. Santa walked toward him, but Rudolph was crying. He thought Santa came to laugh at his nose, too.
　Instead, Santa asked for his help. He said, "You are different, but that is why you are great. Your shiny nose is not bad. It can light up the dark night road. You can be very useful!"
　That night, Rudolph ran at the front of the team. Thanks to his bright nose, they delivered all the presents safely. Rudolph became a hero and the most popular reindeer. The red nose he once hated became his special power. Since that year, nine reindeer pull the sleigh. Rudolph is always at the front, helping Santa carry dreams to the world.
